# Week2_Challenge
## VBA Refactor Challenge  

## Overview of Project:
  Main objective of the project is to help Steve to help his parents to make a better selection of investment in stocks based on the results of the previous years agains and looses of the particular stocks. He also wants to make sure his parents to diversify the investment in multiple stocks based on the results from the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock


## Results:
  From the `green_stocks.xlsm` the total daily volume of each stock calculated and the yearly return to measure how well each stock performed.
Since the interested stock of Steve parents performed low he wants to calculate the total daily volume of each ticker and the return.
Using the refractoring the entire stock is tracked over the years.

### Results from each ticker 2017:

### Runtime for 2017:

### Results from each ticker 2018:

### Runtime for 2018:

## Summary:

- In `2017` out of the 12 tickers Steve tested only `TERP` have negative turns and 
- In `2018` out of 12 tickets only `ENPH` and `RUN` have positive return and all the other stocks have negative returns.
- 2017 had much better return overall than 2018


### Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring
  Advantages of refractoring is:
1. The code is efficient with few steps in the loop condition.
2. Less memory.
3. Improving the code is easier. 
4.  It can be the entry point at times.

  Disadvantages of refractoring is:
1. If the existing code has bug that were not debugged the future code is hard to figure out the edits to be made in the existing code
2. Code written by one person might be different from the other and hard to collaborate and agree by the programmers.

### Pros and Cons applying the refactoring to the original script 
Pros of using a refractor code saved some time with the typos and syntax erros 
Cons its hard to understand from some ones else perspective when it came to understand the refractor code.
